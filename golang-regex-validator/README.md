# Golang Regex Validator

This tool reads a Golang regular expression from the standard input and checks whether it can be compiled.
The result is indicated by the exit status.

To use it:

```go run regexCompiler.go```

## Test

The tests included in this folder are just for validating that tool
is compliant with the design, but are not validating any of the expressions
from the data contained in this repo.
